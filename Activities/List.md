### List of repositories

Here, we have chosen several programs in various categories. All these programs
are written either in C or C++, and they have a reasonable amount of code. Each
team can choose one repository, and one of the team members should report your
choice in #74.

### CTF Challenge Creation

If you have chosen a web server, you can create a CGI application on top of the
web server to create a CTF challenge. Remember, your `bugN` branches should
contain a valid service that can be exploited by a remote attacker, and a
vanilla web server will not serve any pages that attackers can exploit.
