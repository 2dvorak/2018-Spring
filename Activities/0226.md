# Git Activity (Warm-up)

### Overview

Create a simple program that takes in as input a CSV file and the number of
maximum members in a group, and outputs a list of randomly grouped members. Each
output line should show a sequence of member names without new lines. The names
do not need to be sorted. CSV files contain two columns for (1) names, and (2)
emails. We assume that our CSV data do not contain new lines. You should write a
\texttt{README.md} in Markdown.

### Grading Criteria

1. Do Git logs summarize what each commit is about?
2. Does `README.md` file explain the input and the output of your program?
3. Is the program properly commented?
4. Does the program operate as expected?
5. (Extra) We will give +2 extra points to students who created the most concise
   and readable code.
