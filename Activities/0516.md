# Git-based CTF

Each team should prepare a network service running in a Docker container. We
assume that each team has its own PGP key pair. Students will earn individual
attack points by exploiting other teams' services. Defenses are done in group in
this activity though.

### Schedule

1. Preparation & Injection (5/16 -- 1pm, 5/25)

Each team prepares a Docker image that runs a network service. We strongly
recommend you to use a Dockerfile template we provide. You should import an
open-source project to prepare your service docker. Also, you should pick a
version that is at least three year old. This is to encourage having [unintended
vulnerabilities](#unintended-vulnerabilities). We will provide a private repository for
each team in this phase.

Each team should prepare three intended vulnerabilities along with proofs of
exploitation. You can provide a proof by creating a dockerized exploit script.
We also provide a script that helps this.

2. CTF Exercise (9am, 5/28 -- 9am, 6/1)

We will make every repository public to start a CTF game. Each student will play
the game individually, but may patch their service in group. An attack in
Git-based CTF is a directory that contains an exploit script (or program) and a
Dockerfile that can run the script. The directory should be properly encrypted
and submitted to the opponent's repository as a GitHub issue. We provide a
[script](FIXME) that automatically does this.

### Vulnerabilities

##### Intended vulnerabilities

These vulnerabilities are injected by students, and there are corresponding
working exploits for each of the intended vulnerabilities.

##### Unintended vulnerabilities

These vulnerabilities may or may not exist in the original program. Since we ask
students to use old version (at least three-year-old version), there may be
already known vulnerabilities (e.g., from CVEs), and such vulnerabilities are
also considered as *unintended* in this activity.
